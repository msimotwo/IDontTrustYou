# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Implementation 🚀

Welcome! This project showcases how to build a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**—a modern approach to securing sensitive systems. Whether you're new to cybersecurity or an experienced professional, you'll find practical insights here.

---

## 🌟 What is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)?
Zero Trust means: **Never trust, always verify**. It’s about ensuring that:
- Everyone is **verified** before accessing resources.
- Access is limited to what’s **necessary** (least privilege).
- Activities are **monitored continuously** for threats.

---

## 🛠️ How Did I Implement ZTA?
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I applied ZTA principles:

1. **🔑 Identity Verification**  
   - Used **Okta** and **Duo Security** for **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.  
   - Goal: Verify every user’s identity before granting access.

2. **🔒 Network Micro-Segmentation**  
   - Deployed **VMware NSX** to divide the network into secure segments.  
   - Why? To isolate critical assets and prevent attackers from moving laterally.

3. **📜 Access Controls**  
   - Implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**.  
   - Purpose: Ensure users only access what they need—nothing more.

4. **📈 Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Integrated **Splunk** and **Microsoft Sentinel** for real-time activity monitoring.  
   - Result: Detected unusual behavior quickly and responded to threats.
